# Find_Different_Data
This Python code imports data from an Excel file into a Pandas dataframe and aggregates data from specific columns into a single list. It assigns the duplicate data to a cluster and then removes the duplicate data to make a list. Adds items in a particular column to a list and removes duplicate items. Finally, it makes another list of items that are in one list of items in a particular column but not in the other list, and saves the result in an Excel file.
